Over the last couple of years I've been re-trained from Heavy Duty Mechanics to I.T. at the Academy of Learning with honors . I have a strong aptitude for working with technology, problem solving and strong desire to learn. In addition, I'm knowledgeable in computer hardware, networking, and computer languages.

In 2011, I took web development (HTML, CSS) at BCIT in Burnaby. Now at the end of 2020, I've started to get back into web technologies by making websites and taking online classes(Udemy) in HTML, CSS, and Javascript as prep for a Frontend Web Developer position.
